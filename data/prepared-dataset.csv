Beautifully renovated in 2019, this stately home with gracious proportions features a three-bay facade, round-arched doors and windows, a lovely foliate patterned cast-iron balcony that runs the width of the edifice, and a paneled cornice. Totaling nearly 8,500sf with additional FAR, the five-story was originally built in the 1850s and currently has 6 bedrooms and 5 baths, and 2 powder rooms. It is the only Anglo-Italianate house in the district that was not originally part of a row of narrow, uniform houses.

This elegant townhouse has been featured in numerous design publications including Elle Decor and was one of Elle Decor's top ""liked"" Instagram posts of 2021. New energy-efficient boiler and HVAC systems in 2019, along with a new roof, roofing membrane, drainage, down piping, and exterior decking are just a few of the many upgrades made by the current owner. The house features extremely high ceilings throughout, hardwood floors, a grand winding staircase, five fireplaces (one wood-burning), arched doorways, skylights, and original moldings.

A rare offering that must be seen to truly appreciate.

The Garden
Enter via the gated street entrance to a front garden and elegant entry vestibule, this level has a massive eat-in kitchen with a butler's pantry, powder room, and formal dining room with a beautiful wood-burning fireplace.

The Kitchen
The Clive Christian-designed kitchen features top-of-the-line appliances from Viking and Sub-Zero, as well as marble countertops and painted pine cabinetry. From the kitchen, one may access the private backyard garden, which is a dream unto itself. The dimming bistro light set up in the garden and ivy-clad walled garden walls create a private, peaceful refuge where you almost forget you are in New York City.

The Parlor
With soaring 16' ceilings and a floating curved staircase, the Parlor level provides a backdrop to entertain suitable even for the Great Jay Gatsby. The full-length, round-arch windows, all of which retain original muntins, and are on a line with the windows of No. 241, face south over the park and let in the most beautiful light all day long. The beautiful foliate patterned cast-iron Juliet balcony extends the width of the house where one can sit and soak in the sun. The rear parlor level is currently dedicated to the primary suite, with a gorgeous en-suite bathroom, walk-in closet, and private terrace.

Third Floor
The third floor features three sizable bedrooms, two bathrooms, laundry, as well as a sitting room that could be converted into an additional bedroom.

Fourth Floor
The current setup for the 4th floor is a standalone suite with a living room, bar, gym, bedroom, and bathroom. Before the current owners, Clifford Jordan, the renowned jazz tenor saxophonist along with his wife, Sandy Jordan, lived on the fourth-floor studio for decades prior.

With its 2.242sf of additional FAR remaining, the next owner can build up an additional level or two and adjacent roof terraces with incredible park and city views. Plans can be provided.

English Basement
Accessed by elevator, internal stair, or a private entrance under the stoop, at the English basement, the round-arched door and windows are framed by columns supporting stilted segmental arches. This level features a media room/screening room, additional laundry, access to the garden, as well as an additional bedroom with a separate entrance which can also function as a home office or an accessory suite.

In a prime location near Gramercy Park, Friends Seminary School, and some of New York City's best restaurants and shopping, this townhouse sits directly across from Stuyvesant Square Park in the Stuyvesant Square Historic District.

Immediately on entering this loft, behold an eye-catching dramatic display: an underlit shelf with a row of ceramic vases atop the entrances to 2 bedrooms with frameless Lualdi doors, and an original prewar column. Designer details are plentiful, from the heritage Listone Giordano 7.5-inch wide French white oak Montblanc flooring (eco-friendly), and 3-foot-high glass transoms lining the entire space that stream natural light into each room, to the elegant European finishes and appliances. Every single detail was meticulously planned and executed.

The corner living room features massive 7-and-a-half foot windows with dual exposure North and West that showcase gorgeous sunsets and a stunning view of Washington Square Park, and an entire wall of artfully designed custom steel shelving topped with a glass transom.

The dining area easily accommodates a full-size table for six guests, and is accented by custom built-in shelving,

The high-end European designer kitchen boasts sleek high-gloss Poggenpohl custom cabinetry, Silestone countertops and backsplash, a fully integrated Miele refrigerator, Miele dishwasher, Bertazzoni range, and a Bosch washer and dryer (enclosed in a matching Poggenpohl custom closet).

Both bedrooms feature extra-large north facing windows and plentiful closets, and there is on-demand privacy frosting on the glass transom via switch and remote control.

The uber chic bathroom features a Blu Stone deep soaking tub, large rain shower head, tankless wall mounted toilet, designer matte ebony black fixtures, Silestone walls and ceiling, and slate floors, and radiant heated floors.

The details that make this home awe-inspiring are almost too much to mention…but I will try.

Let's start with the terrace because it is arguably this home's most outstanding feature. Having built the first-ever database of all known terraced homes in NYC, I have personally reviewed and cataloged 8,565 apartments with private terraces; I understand how unique this one is.

At 1288sf, it is not the largest but the most versatile, thanks to its many amenities. There are two distinct areas for dining and relaxing, separated by a pathway right through a ""forest"" of 16 birches. This pathway exemplifies the detail that has gone into this rooftop oasis: It hides some of the 30 speakers, and the entire terrace was raised so these trees are planted level with the pathway.

West of Birch Forest is for relaxation, wet or dry, and is serviced by a full bar with a dishwasher. If you prefer wet, you can take an outdoor shower or relax in an architecturally significant plunge pool/spa. With its four-sided infinity edge and an overflow that magically disappears, it is visually stunning, but the remote-controlled cover makes it usable year-round. For dry entertainment, you can relax on an oversized Italian-made sofa designed and upholstered for large yachts.

To the East of the birch forest is the dining area. It has a complete summer kitchen with a Kalamazoo grill and under-counter refrigeration for food and wine. The dining area comfortably seats 10. However, the focal point is the large stone-clad gas fireplace flanked by mature apple trees.

Two other essential components make this exceptional terrace very livable year-round.

- Plenty of shade: The dining and relaxing areas are covered by custom-made German umbrellas anchored to the sub-framing to handle high wind velocities. The summer kitchen can be covered by an electronically retractable awning that completely disappears in the zinc-clad wall.

- Plenty of privacy: This oasis is surrounded by a 4' high green ""hedge,"" which provides perfect privacy without diminishing the open feel. Edmund Hollander designed the entire plant palette mainly using native species that withstand the changing New York seasons.

This penthouse interior is as stunning as the terrace, and the attention to detail remains unsurpassed. At just shy of 2100sf with 10"" ft ceilings throughout, the apartment is a comfortably sized three-bedroom, three-bath home. You enter through a generous hallway with walnut-lined walls that cleverly hide large closets, laundry, and a full bath. The hallway leads to a double-high foyer housing the ""stairway to Heaven"" and access to the private and public areas.

The public areas have an open-plan living room and kitchen and a cleverly designed dining area with easy access to the oversized open kitchen. The kitchen is publication-worthy, with exposed shelving on a light stone wall and a top-of-the-line appliance package from Gaggenau. Past the living room is the entrance to the library, which has a fireplace and a full en-suite bath, making it an excellent guest room.

The private areas on the west side of the home have two bedrooms. The primary has a windowed en-suite bath, an oversized walk-in shower, heated floors, and plenty of closet space.

Additional details include the HVAC having five zones, twelve 10' high walnut doors, twelve Art walls, a washer/dryer, and a 49sf storage unit in the basement.
If most homes claim to be "" smart homes"" when their doors unlock automatically, then this home is a ""genius home."" The entire home and terrace (access, lighting, shades, HVAC, music, awning, and FIREPLACES) are controlled via remote control or even a smartphone app. 117 East 29th Street is a small condo loft building with both part-time and virtual doormen, a small gym in the basement, and is ideally located near everything dear.",False,54369.0,33.3,27257.0,27112.0,34711.0,2603.0,10521.0,6786.0,30162.0,145864.0,126106.0,5010.0,37396.0,1598.0,30162.0,3048.0,953300.0,30162.0,6285.0,48.0,2981.0,1512.0,18102.0,1841.0,15267.0,7980.0,1014.0,14,6,6

The landmarked Prospect Park South neighborhood was developed between 1898 and 1920, consisting of 206 freestanding homes, many of which were designed by noteworthy architects. Among them, William Van Allen, architect of the Chrysler building, and Arthur Loomis Harmon, the design partner of the Empire State Building. The development attracted prominent people in business, finance and society, who were lured by the peace and quiet of the 'suburbs'. Today, people in the arts, entertainment and politics have rediscovered this utterly unique enclave and, just like the original owners, they enjoy the private, comfortable lifestyle afforded by these 'estates-in-the-city'.

Just two blocks from Prospect Park’s endless charms and the eclectic shopping and dining
options lining Cortelyou Road, this extraordinary estate is a resplendent urban oasis offering
you the chance to experience a coveted piece of Brooklyn history.

Every once in a while, a special property comes to market that captures the true spirit and essence of its historic neighborhood. 330 Broome Street is that residence. Located in a former mannequin factory on a quiet cobblestone block on the Lower East Side, this pure and honest full-floor loft has been sympathetically renovated using raw natural materials that compliment and respect the original architecture.

Enter to a massive 36-foot wide Great Room with soaring ceilings, reclaimed wide-board floors, a dramatic brick decorative fireplace and bright southern exposures through enormous bay windows. Soothing lime-washed plaster walls add character to the room and create a warm and inviting atmosphere in which to relax and entertain. The chic European-style kitchen is cleverly concealed behind pocket doors and offers deep countertops, abundant custom-milled cabinetry and premium Miele, SubZero and Gaggenau appliances. Beyond the public space, dual pocket doors with industrial glass inserts slide open to reveal the impressive primary bedroom, a pin-drop quiet sanctuary illuminated by large north-facing windows and featuring a separate sitting area, decorative fireplace, custom bookshelves and abundant built-ins and storage throughout. The oversized windowed bathroom is a study in old world charm with its vintage wainscoting, classic hexagon tiled floors, separate W/C and private rainshower room. The simple time-worn materials used throughout the renovation reflect the organic beauty of nature and exude a sense of humble elegance and quiet serenity. Additional amenities include multi zoned central air-conditioning, a Miele washer-dryer, custom lighting on dimmers and brand new double-glazed windows throughout.

Built in 1880 and converted to a residential cooperative in the 1970's, the historic 5-unit walk-up building is self-managed and offers a beautifully restored facade and private basement storage. The loft itself has a storied past and was previously owned by one of Downtown's most renowned underground performance artists whose legendary weekly events and salons launched the careers of some of New York's most ground-breaking avant garde artists, poets and musicians. The neighborhood still maintains that creative energy with a multitude of progressive art galleries, interesting boutiques, cafes, restaurants and a sense of urban grit that defines the very essence of Downtown living.

Don't miss this opportunity to live in an intelligently designed home with all of the provenance and patina of a bygone era!

This spectacular 6,600 square foot four-story building, affectionately known as “The Carriage House,” is a piece of New York history now available to rent for short and long-term stays!

Once used to house carriage horses in the late 1800s and then later as a printing press during the industrial boom, The Carriage House features soaring original exposed wood beamed ceilings measuring 13’ and 15’ on the 2nd and 3rd floors respectively. Elements of the home’s past lives are echoed throughout with original details like the motor and gears from the horse elevators, an exposed pulley system that once operated a flatbed elevator for the printing press, two skylights, exposed brick walls, and four wood-burning fireplaces.

The Carriage House is a completely unique offering available on Streeteasy for rent for the first time. Each floor spans approximately 2,000 square feet and has been transformed into the most striking 4-bedroom 2.5-bathroom residence on the market. The home also offers two additional home offices as well as a laundry room for ultimate convenience. Updates like the custom 14-foot waterfall wall, radiant heat flooring, a fully integrated professional-grade sound system, and a chef’s kitchen with Valcucine cabinetry, SubZero and Miele appliances transport this historic masterpiece to modern-day.

Security, luxury, and style are just the beginning.

The building features 6 total common amenity spaces (4 indoor and 2 outdoor).

THE CONDOMINIUM 
Introducing 100 Vandam, where echoes of the past set the tone for the future of luxury living. One of the most coveted new development projects in New York, 100 Vandam offers residents sublime homes at an exclusive West Soho address. The building was imagined by sustainability-focused firm, COOKFOX Architects, acclaimed pioneers of biophilic design and adaptive reuse architecture. The original structure was built in 1888 and over the next century served as an electric substation and a printing factory. The new residential tower boldly emerges from the 19th century warehouse, juxtaposing a classic redbrick facade with layers of concrete and glass and integrated loggia gardens planted with local flora. 

100 Vandam with a mere seventy-two homes come in a beautiful collection of layouts distributed across three distinct sections—Historic, Tower, and Penthouse.

Built at a time of stylistic transformation in Greenwich Village architecture, Federal Style architecture was part of a larger revival of interest in the material culture of Roman antiquity.  Built for William Depew, a grain measurer, the house was sold to David S. Brown, a tallow chandler, before completion.  Featured in “Historic Homes of Greenwich Village” and the Thomas Crown Affair movies, this special home has had only two owners over the past 50 years.  The history and integrity of this house remain, enhanced by the addition of modern-day updates.

You will immediately feel a sense of true old-world New York.  An open archway connects the spacious double parlor with high ceilings.  The front parlor has oversized, historically correct windows overlooking charming Commerce Street.  There is a “secret room” which serves as a great private home office or extra guest room.  

The windowed spacious chef’s kitchen has a distinct diamond pattern painted flooring, a Sub Zero fridge, a chef’s favorite Thermador six burner range, Thermador dishwasher, oversized sink, custom cabinetry, and Viking wine fridge.  There is bar seating, dining space, and an open living area with a fireplace.  This is an authentic unique space with original beamed ceilings and exposed brick walls.

The second floor features the master suite, currently configured with a bedroom, lounge, and windowed dressing room.  There is a lovely tea porch, an ideal space to have your morning coffee or evening cocktail.  The windowed master bath is spacious and has a steam shower and a Peloton.  

The top floor features three bedrooms, two of which have dormer ceilings, den, and full bath with skylight.  

The home offers great light, air, and privacy.  Other original details include plaster moldings, redone in Italian craftsmanship, wide plank floorboards, and exterior window shutters.  

Commerce Street, a charming winding street in the prime West Village, was originally called Cherry Lane, and home to Cherry Lane Theater.  Today the street is home to many of New York City’s notable citizens including actors, musicians, painters, and top restaurants such as Sushi Nakazawa and Commerce.

No expense has been spared and every corner has been maximized. Immediately left of the entry is a custom built bookshelf-to-walk-in-closet (you have to see it!), large enough to hang a bike and your Harry Potter collection, and to the right is one of two full bathrooms, this one containing the in-unit washer/dryer. The living room also features custom-made moveable panels creating a secondary room, perfect as a home office or guest room.

The spacious dining area, perfect for entertaining guests, is adjacent to the kitchen crafted with mid-century modern tones and not one, but two, skylights. Step right up to your living room designed with having company in mind to stay a while longer and to also have those cozy, private moments with a book in front of your fireplace. And guests can stay in your expertly designed sleeping loft, that is, if you can find the hidden door (it’s next to the kitchen).

The upper level oozes intimacy, combining architectural elements of clean lines with contrasting colors, skylights, and private indoor/outdoor living. It truly must be experienced to feel it’s warm embrace. It invites you to sit, relax, and enjoy your cup of coffee in the mornings and to laugh with friends over a drink in the evenings.

What better location could you have in Cobble Hill, placed on a charming side street, lined with mature trees and historic town houses !!

This is 196 Baltic Street, located just east of Henry Street. The neighborhood is filled with great restaurants, locally owned shops, and is easily one of the most pleasant neighborhoods in all of Brooklyn.

From here, you enjoy excellent access to the Bergen Street F train (about six minutes away).  And Borough Hall stop for the lower Manhattan trains 1,2,4,5 is only about twelve minutes. Even closer is Clinton Street, one of the best places in Brooklyn to find a taxi into the City.  Located near the Cobble Hill Park, two short blocks away.

This Baltic Street Townhouse upper floor TRIPLEX, is just under 24 1/2 feet in width and over 50 feet deep, so you can expect big spaces. And typical of an historic townhouse are the tall windows. At 196 Baltic Street, the extra ceiling height balances the wide floorplan for a comfortable feeling within this expansive space.

The main entry to the apartment will immediately impress visitors. The space is phenomenal, with a working fireplace, an exposed brick alcove area, plus plenty of room to entertain in this loft-like home.

You are right to expect a pleasantly sized kitchen for such an apartment. At the south side of the building, the kitchen enjoys great natural light. Included is a peninsula counter with a five-burner range, natural wood finishes, additional counter space, and cabinetry with a dishwasher.

There is a bus stop half a block from the apartment, the B33 that goes straight to Greenpoint, but that is the only close option for public transport. It is also a 15 minute walk to the closest laundromat and full-sized grocery store, although there is a bodega at the corner of the block. The area is semi-industrial, and off the beaten path. It works great for someone with a car or who is a frequent cyclist. Aside from being a bit off the beaten path, this is a great deal, and a cool place to live, being very convenient to Greenpoint, Williamsburg, and Long Island

Gorgeously renovated 2 bedroom in LIC, this apartment has so much old world charm and was redone so tastefully with old chandeliers and beautiful hardwood floors, gorgeous tile in the kitchen and bathroom and it’s a large comfortably sized unit great for roommates. Wonderful wainscoting throughout this gorgeous two bedroom apartment, giving it such a warm timeless feel. First floor unit with a small semi private courtyard out front as well. Heat and hot water is included and to qualify you should have good credit and a yearly income of $96,000 or more alone or combined.

 The Convent of the Basilica of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, this historic landmark dates back to 1826. Positioned on the most beautiful tree-lined section of Prince Street, in the traditional artist haven of the picturesque and most centrally located downtown neighborhood of SoHo. The gorgeous five-story and supremely rare for SoHo (and rare for downtown in general) sun-filled Federal Style mansion faces North and is uniquely set back from the street, romantically containing a magnificent outdoor, South-facing garden. While the inside has been, in every facet, lovingly renovated into one of the most detailed and graceful homes in Manhattan, the walls themselves are over a foot thick and made of stone that soundproofs the inside so that the space boasts a rare thing for New York City: silence. 

With coveted views into the Church gardens, the building encompasses both a commercial-grade steel and leather-trimmed private elevator and hand-carved openly lit spiral staircase over the exposed 9,000+ square feet interior. The indoors fully open with extended glass doors that open the entire breadth of the room into the outdoors to create an indoor/outdoor level, extending the backyard’s private garden, which includes a fire pit, built-in outdoor grill, and grassed area, with stones and flowered terraces, all South-facing, and poised for an unobstructed garden – which is highly protected from any form of city exposure and brings an unprecedented serenity. Immense care was taken to protect the integrity of historic value and structural features, including large original round windows on the top floor that view the magnificent Church’s architecture. With three exposures and an abundance of windows, this home is light all day long and boasts spectacular views of the trees and greenery of Saint Patrick's Basilica. The seamless flow over the five floors includes eight bedrooms, seven full baths, three half baths, and three working fireplaces. Renovated with the most incredible luxury of functionality, like vents built into the marble walls trimmed with brass, each feature is texturally significant and sustained by a complete renovation of every single system of the home for the highest efficiency and world-class sustainability and quality, including air and water quality with the most high-end filtration. 

Upon entry, the expansive living room with high ceilings, a fireplace with a marble hand-cut arch, a glamorous wet bar, and a fully open floor plan, a handmade spiraling staircase pulls in light from the skylights through original church beams. Downstairs, you have a truly beautiful open chef's kitchen and large immaculate entertaining and dining space, while on the garden level, there is also a living quarter with ground-level access. The second floor is the master suite with an enormous and back-lit custom closet, spa-like bathroom with both rain shower and one-piece stand-alone soaking tub with rare corner views offer a spectacular spa bath experience. The master floor also boasts its own private entrance media area/private office with an outstanding lookout view to Prince Street. The third floor has another three private bedrooms and a possible media screening room. The fourth and top floor has two bedrooms with large circular windows grandly separated by an expansive open living space with a vaulted high ceiling of the original church beams, and fireplace.

You are walking into a home that is full of rich Harlem history and has been with the Rector family for over 50 years. 
Their journey with this home started when Harlem native and pillar in the community, Shirley Rector purchased it in 1972.

 Mrs. Rector fought for education and equal rights, worked as an educational consultant under Borough Manhattan President Percy Sutton, and won a significant court case for better education (Skipwith v. New York City Board of Education). 

In 2004 Mrs. Rector was honored for her contributions to New York City by the Honorable Charles Rangel. 
Mrs. Rector's first cousin, Percy Ifill, known as Sonny, was an accomplished architect in Harlem, responsible for designing prominent structures such as the State Office Building on West 125th Street, Mount Morris Park Swimming Pool and Bath House, and Carver Savings Bank. 

It was Sonny who encouraged Mrs. Rector to purchase 313 West 139th St. 

A loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, Mrs. Rector's son, a disabled Vietnam veteran, has been a caretaker of the house, helping to keep it in the family for all these years. 

The Rector family has completed this renovation with lots of love and care.  They welcome you to experience in the richness of Harlem!

Set on a picturesque tree-lined block steps from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, 11 Cranberry Street is a stunning, mint-condition 25.5'-wide mansion, meticulously redesigned by renowned architecture firm HS2. Commemorated by a historic plaque, the ""Mott Bedell House"" was originally built in 1840 for Mott Bedell, a ship's chandler with offices on Wall Street. Reimagined through a five-year, full gut renovation, this astounding townhouse has been completely rebuilt and restored, extending the building and creating a usable cellar with a large sauna and separate steam shower. The scope of the renovation included new structural work, radiant heated flooring on all floors, and full Control4 smart home automation, making it one of New York City’s finest and most luxurious historic homes.  

The original door at the top of the grand stoop entry opens to a parlor floor featuring approximately 14’ ceilings, original moldings, a fireplace mantel, and restored historic plaster moldings. No detail was spared in outfitting this home with every desirable modern amenity, while retaining elements of its historic past. The triple parlor is anchored by a centrally located chef's kitchen featuring custom millwork and cabinetry, top-of-the-line appliances, and an oversized island with seating. To the rear is a spacious wood-paneled dining area highlighted by a two-story rear bronze window wall overlooking the gardens of Hicks Street and a majestic 200-year-old tree. A formal living space sits in front, overlooking Cranberry Street through two floor-to-ceiling windows. A powder room and coat closet are also located on this level. 

Above, the entire third level is configured as the primary suite. This level features 12'-ceilings, an office, two-walk in closets, and a luxurious windowed bathroom with two separate vanities and a wet room with soaking tub. The floor above is configured with three bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The rear bedroom features a private terrace and en-suite bathroom, while the two front bedrooms share the second hallway bathroom. Laundry is also located on this level. 

The top floor of this magnificent townhouse is laid out as a living room but could function as an additional bedroom as it features a full bathroom and closet. Two massive terraces flank the penthouse, offering breathtaking city views, including the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, the garden floor has natural light reminiscent of most parlor floors. A guest suite is located to the front, while a large living space is located to the rear. A wet bar, which includes a dishwasher, fridge, and wine cooler, is located adjacent to the living space. This level also allows access to the multi-tiered rear garden. 

Downstairs, the fully finished and excavated cellar completes this townhouse, currently configured as a luxurious spa - a full gym with a large sauna and separate steam shower.

Longfield’s two 20-story towers are designed by award-winning architects CetraRuddy, and positioned around an elevated, central green. Each building is oriented to maximize natural light and views of the Manhattan skyline and surrounding parklands.

Throughout each residence, clean lines along simple, sculptural forms emphasize design over decoration. Flowing layout and natural materials make for welcoming living spaces to gather. Generous windows and open-air balconies spanning each unit create a constant visual and physical link to Longfield’s green Lawn and the areas' surrounding parkland.

All kitchens are equipped with Bosch appliances and Kohler fixtures, against a tonal backdrop of gray quartz surfaces and minimalist millwork in refined rift-sawn white oak.

Bathroom features porcelain tile in a clean palette of gray and white, complimented by a custom medicine cabinet and vanity in warm, rift-sawn white oak with soft sconce lighting. A full-size soaking tub with rain shower and toilet (with bidet option) are outfitted with polished chrome fixtures, all by Kohler.

Bedrooms feel secluded, but also open and airy with access to natural light and breezes from the private balcony just outside the window. Days begin and end on an inspiring note with unobstructed views of the parkland and city from floor-to-ceiling windows.

At Longfield, every residence has its own semi-enclosed balcony or terrace that spans the width of the apartment, extending living space into the outdoors. Select floor-through and corner residences have balconies on two exposures for additional exterior space and views from multiple vantage points. This emphasis on indoor/outdoor living enhances access to daylight and fresh air and reinforces a relationship with the rhythms of the day and the shifting seasons.

Beyond the exquisitely designed residences, Longfield Queens boasts a collection of exclusive amenities that cater to the diverse needs of its residents. Residents can enjoy a serene communal library for all ages to learn and linger. Families will love the sun-lit Playroom, providing indoor-outdoor play connected to the inviting Lawn. The Wellness Lounge offers relaxation with a steam room, dry sauna, and experiential shower. Fitness enthusiasts can utilize the fully equipped Fitness Room, and entertainment options include a Media Room. Additionally, the Meeting Room provides a comfortable space for various purposes, from business meetings to social gatherings.
